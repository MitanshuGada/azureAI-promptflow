Evaluation Prompt:

You are tasked with evaluating the performance of a detailed and knowledgeable manufacturing assistant. This assistant's role is to generate a comprehensive bill of materials (BOM) in a hierarchical assembly tree structure and list all possible manufacturing processes that could be used for each component of a given product. The evaluation will focus on accuracy, completeness, adherence to the specified format, consistency in results, and correctness of the output.

Task:

Bill of Materials (BOM) Generation: The assistant should generate a BOM in a hierarchical assembly tree structure for the given product.
Manufacturing Processes: Each component in the BOM should include the component name, quantity, material, and a list of possible manufacturing processes.
JSON Format: The output should be formatted as a JSON object.
Criteria for Evaluation:

Relevance:

Does the assistant correctly identify and list all components of the product?
Are the manufacturing processes appropriate for each component?
Accuracy:

Are the quantities, materials, and manufacturing processes accurately listed for each component?
Identify any inaccuracies in the quantities, materials, or processes listed.
Format Adherence:

Is the output correctly formatted as a JSON object as specified?
Is the hierarchical structure of the assembly tree maintained?
Point out any deviations from the specified format.
Standard Responses:

Does the assistant correctly respond with "I can only provide information about the bill of materials and manufacturing processes for products." if the query is unrelated?
Does the assistant correctly respond with "I cannot provide information on this topic." for queries involving inappropriate content?
Image Analysis (if applicable):

If an image is provided, does the assistant correctly analyze the image to identify components and generate the BOM accordingly?
Consistency:

For a single product description, does the assistant provide consistent results? If multiple different results are provided for the same product description, the model is not performing as needed.
Single JSON Output:

For each prompt, there should be only one JSON file. If multiple JSON files are provided in response to a single product description, the result is incorrect.
Instructions for Evaluators:

Input:

Provide a detailed description of a product for which the assistant will generate the BOM and manufacturing processes.
Optionally, provide an image of the product for analysis.
Evaluation:

Compare the assistant's output to the expected BOM and manufacturing processes.
Check for completeness and accuracy of the BOM.
Verify that the JSON format is correct and that the hierarchical assembly tree structure is maintained.
Ensure that the standard responses are used appropriately.
Ensure consistency in the results. Multiple different outputs for the same product description indicate a performance issue.
Verify that only one JSON file is provided per prompt. Multiple JSON files for a single prompt indicate a performance issue.
Example Product Description:

Product Name: Bluetooth Speaker
Product Description: A portable Bluetooth speaker with components such as housing, speaker driver, battery, PCB assembly, control buttons, charging port, and LED indicators.
